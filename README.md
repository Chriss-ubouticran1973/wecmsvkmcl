Oh man, just walked out of the theater and I’m still trying to process what I just saw in Death of a Unicorn. It’s like my brain’s trying to catch up with my eyes, you know? There are popcorn crumbs still stuck to my jeans, and the back of my neck is aching from that terrible seat. Seriously, who designs these theaters? They should hire me to redecorate, right?

So anyway, the  . It was... wow. Kind of like having your mind thrown into a blender. Points where you couldn’t tell if the unicorn was a dream or a metaphor or like, just a regular horse with a party hat? My head’s spinning trying to make sense of it. I think there was this one scene where the unicorn was glowing — like, glowing with this amazing warmth — but then it flickered out kind of like those dodgy fluorescent lights at the pharmacy. Dude, that was intense. 

> Oh, and the sound — I could barely hear some lines over the chatter of the crowd. Felt like everyone was munching their popcorn way too loudly around me. Ever felt like you’ve been caught in a parallel universe where   food sounds are 300% louder? Yeah, that’s my life now.

Remember that bit in the forest? The trees were all tangled up like my old heap of Christmas lights in the attic – made it feel eerie but beautiful, like an accidental masterpiece you can’t recreate. Or maybe like interior design on caffeine and zero sleep. 

Oh! Someone on my floor the other day was asking if they should 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , and like, honestly? If you can get past the weirdness, yes. 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  . It’s like... abstract painting therapy but with more hooves.

Part of me is still stuck on the whole “is the unicorn a figment of grief, hope, or the last ice cream cone in a child’s dream?” It’s like trying to choose the right wallpaper pattern: impossible to decide, but worth getting lost in the infinite possibilities.

Look, I’m still all over the place. I need coffee or maybe a nap. Or a better chair to sit on and let my spine recover. Anyway, catch it while it’s still showing. Or not. Who knows.
